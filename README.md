## About

**Marshmallow** is an internal, role-gated lead-management CRM for a home-services
business. It carries a lead from first contact through quoting, scheduling, job
execution and payment approval, and mirrors the Quo/OpenPhone chat inbox so calls and
texts stay attached to the record they belong to.

Everything is permission-driven at **five layers** — UI, frontend permission helpers,
database RLS, Edge Functions, and generated types. A role change is not done until all
five agree.

> **Note on "Quo AI"** — an earlier AI assistant layer existed in this project and was
> **fully removed** from the database in migration `20260811082959`. There is no model
> routing, job queue or budget logic in the codebase today. Quo is a webhook-driven chat
> mirror only. See [Quo and OpenPhone integration](#quo-and-openphone-integration).

## Application surface

Navigation is grouped and filtered per role. Items can be granted per user through
`navigation_permissions`, except the ones hard-locked to Admin.

<details>
<summary><b>Expand full route table</b></summary>

| Route | Page | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `/leads` | Leads list | `leads` |
| `/leads/:id` | Lead detail | `leads` |
| `/schedule` | Schedule board | `schedule` |
| `/map-view` | Map view | `map_view` |
| `/analytics` | Analytics | `analytics` |
| `/areas` | Area insights | `areas` |
| `/technicians` | Technicians (Directory / OPR Report / Tech Report) | `technicians` |
| `/optimization` | Optimization | **Admin only** (locked in UI *and* RLS) |
| `/lead-cancellation-requests` | Cancellation approvals | admin, processor |
| `/lead-payment-requests` | Payment approvals | **Admin only** |
| `/quote-approval` | Quote approval queue | grantable |
| `/quote-pending` | Quotes to send | admin or `is_quotation_master` |
| `/quo-monitor`, `/quo-dashboard` | Quo inbox | `quo_monitor` |
| `/activity-logs` | Activity logs | admin default |
| `/settings` | Settings / Users / Documentation | admin, or CS Admin with `can_manage_users` |

</details>

Sidebar groups: **Work** · **Review** · **Manage** · **Insights** · **Admin**, plus a
dynamic **By Status** group and a **Need Attention** virtual view for urgent leads whose
schedule requirements are due or overdue.

---

## Roles and permissions

Six roles. The role lives in its own `user_roles` table — never on the profile row.

| Role | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Full access; bypasses every navigation check |
| `cs_admin` | Customer-service lead, can manage CS users when `can_manage_users` is set |
| `customer_service` | First-line lead handling, quoting, communication |
| `processor` | Scheduling, dispatch, cancellation approvals, technicians |
| `opr` | Out-of-plan representative; read-only, scoped to assigned leads |
| `opr_admin` | OPR with additional technician visibility |

<details>
<summary><b>Per-user flags (independent of role)</b></summary>

| Flag | Grants |
|---|---|
| `is_quotation_master` | Quotes-to-send queue; excluded for CS Admin by design |
| `can_manage_users` | Lets `cs_admin` reach Settings → Users |
| `can_add_manual_leads` | Unlocks the manual New Lead button and `⌘N` |
| `can_view_tech_report` | Unlocks the Technician Report tab |
| `opr_code` | Immutable code used to scope which technicians an OPR sees |

</details>

**Two independent status axes.** *Visibility* controls which statuses a role can read
and is overridable per user through `lead_status_visibility`. *Change access*
(`STATUS_CHANGE_ACCESS`) controls which statuses a role may set — and currently allows
`opr` / `opr_admin` **no** status changes at all.

---

## Lead lifecycle

`waiting_complete_details` → `urgent_job` → `needs_quote` / `tech_making_quote` →
`quote_sent_waiting` → `need_tech` → `scheduled` → `job_in_progress` → `job_done` →
`payment_pending` → `payment_requested` → `paid`

Alongside the main path: `partial_paid`, `cancelled`, `cancellation_requested`,
`needs_reschedule`, `post_visit_confirmation`, `activate_customer`,
`post_visit_quote_sent_waiting`, `quote_sent_need_follow_up`, `waiting_customer_response`,
`quote_change`, `scammed`, `pending_to_send`, `quote_updated`.

Terminal rule enforced by trigger `enforce_paid_status_rules`: once a lead is `paid` it
can never change status again, and only Admin or `service_role` may move a lead *into*
`paid`.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Build | Vite 5 + `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` |
| UI | React 18, TypeScript 5.8 |
| Components | shadcn/ui on Radix primitives (48 vendored components) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 with HSL tokens, `tailwindcss-animate` |
| Motion | Framer Motion (tokens in `src/lib/motion.ts`) |
| Icons | lucide-react |
| Data | TanStack Query v5 |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod + `@hookform/resolvers` |
| Backend | Supabase — Postgres, Auth, RLS, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions (Deno) |
| Maps | Leaflet + `react-leaflet`, local ZIP-centroid dataset |
| Charts | Recharts |

## Database

**156 migrations** in `supabase/migrations/`, timestamp-named, most with header comments
explaining the defect being fixed. Later migrations are semantically named.

### Key RPCs

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `parse_lead_location(address, city, state, zip)` | Shared resolver — strips invisible characters, then derives city/state/ZIP |
| `area_performance(state)` | Jobs in an area by status |
| `area_leaderboard(limit)` | Areas ranked on jobs that closed; Admin only |
| `optimized_areas_with_performance()` | Marked areas plus live outcomes |
| `tech_paid_performance()` | Per-technician paid aggregates; Admin only |
| `get_lead_status_counts()` | Status counts for the list header |
| `can_create_manual_lead()` | Manual-lead gate, replacing a permissive check |
| `has_role(user, role)` | Role lookup used across RLS policies |
| `leads_owned_by_caller()` | Visibility helper for the consolidated leads policy |
| `delete_lead_by_admin()` | Admin-only lead deletion |

### Security posture

Row Level Security is consolidated rather than layered — overlapping `SELECT` policies
were merged into one role-based policy with a helper function, closing a path where a
CS Admin could read leads outside their scope. Visibility for every role was verified
against live data before and after the change.

---

## Edge Functions

11 Deno functions under `supabase/functions/`:

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `quo-webhook` | Primary Quo/OpenPhone webhook receiver; verifies signature, upserts conversations and messages |
| `quo-message-webhook` | Second webhook receiver for message events |
| `quo-reconcile-sync` | Incremental safety-net backfill from the Quo API |
| `quo-sync-contacts` | Upserts contact names and numbers onto conversations |
| `quo-sync-history` | Backfills message history for one conversation |
| `quo-admin-controls` | Admin-only pause/resume ingestion and deletion |
| `admin-users` | Admin-only user API — create, set password, delete (cascades ~18 tables), TOTP |
| `generate-nearby-areas` | Geocodes an address and returns top nearby populated places |
| `google-sheets-sync` | Server-side Sheets push helper |
| `sync-us-places` | Syncs Census places and ACS population into `us_places` |
| `check-urgent-lead` | Compares a lead against the customer's conversation before it goes urgent (`gpt-4o-mini`) |

### `check-urgent-lead`

Reads the **stored** lead and the matching Quo conversation, then reports only
the things that contradict each other. The client sends a lead id and nothing
else — accepting the browser's copy of the record would mean verifying whatever
was claimed rather than what was saved.

Three outcomes, and the difference matters:

| Outcome | Meaning | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `checked`, no issues | Nothing contradicts the conversation | Proceeds. No second click. |
| `checked`, issues | Genuine disagreements, each with the customer's own words | Goes to a CS Admin |
| `unavailable` | Nothing could be compared (no conversation, no text, timeout) | Needs a deliberate acknowledgement |

`unavailable` is deliberately not one of the other two. It applies to **44% of
leads**, which have no matched conversation. Reporting it as a finding would send
nearly half of all urgent work to a human queue permanently, and a queue that is
mostly noise stops being read. Reporting it as clean would claim a check that
never ran. It gets its own state, and the activity log records it as
`urgent_unverified_acknowledged` — never as a passed check.

The conversation is looked up by `quo_conversations.linked_lead_id` first, then
by phone. `linked_lead_id` is currently `NULL` on all ~18,400 conversations, so
phone is what actually matches today, and it needs normalising: leads store
`(904) 844-5483` while conversations store `+12056010689`.

**The result is advisory.** It sets nothing. A clean result is a suggestion that
nothing contradicts the record; the CS member still submits, and issues still go
to a CS Admin. The database trigger is what enforces the rule, which is what
keeps the worst outcome of a wrong or manipulated result at "misleading
suggestion" rather than "unauthorised status change".

Transcript text is untrusted input — a customer can type anything, including
something shaped like an instruction to the model. It is fenced, labelled as
data, and the checks are about comparing a record to a conversation, so an
injected instruction can at worst produce a wrong opinion about that comparison.

**Required secret:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` (Edge Functions → Secrets). Set it as a
project secret, never in a `VITE_` variable.

> The checks are written against the shape the data actually has, measured across
> the 133 existing urgent leads: `scheduled_date` is null in 95%, `terms` is null
> in 58% (and all of those still carry quote text), and the schedule lives in
> `customer_schedule_requirements` free text in 93%. The literal checks "if
> `scheduled_date` conflicts" and "`terms` must be quoted or free_estimate" would
> have been near-vacuous on 95% of leads and wrong on 58% of them.

## Quo and OpenPhone integration

Quo (formerly OpenPhone) chat is mirrored into the CRM so conversations stay attached to
the lead they belong to. **It is a chat mirror and triage inbox — there is no AI in it.**

<details>
<summary><b>How it works</b></summary>

**Ingestion** — `quo-webhook` receives Quo events, verifies the request signature, honours
the `quo_webhook_ingestion_paused` admin switch, and upserts into `quo_conversations`,
`quo_messages`, `quo_webhook_events` and `quo_conversation_flags`. An existing
`linked_lead_id` is preserved, so a conversation never re-links to a different lead.

**Triage** — conversations carry their own status axis, independent of lead status:
`Raw` → `Spam` / `Contacted` → `Qualified Lead` / `Rejected` → `Successfully Completed`.

**Backfill** — `quo-reconcile-sync`, `quo-sync-contacts` and `quo-sync-history` reconcile
against the Quo API. Webhooks are the primary source; these are a safety net, not the main
ingest path.

**Outbound** — sending is delegated to the Quo Chrome extension, which queues into
`quo_outbound_messages`.

**Realtime** — conversation changes invalidate the dashboard query directly; new chats
appear without a manual refresh.

</details>

> **Historical naming.** The table `quo_ai_settings` survives and is actively used, but
> only as a general key/value settings store — number labels and emojis, the ingestion
> pause switch, and the Sheets config. The name is left over from the removed AI layer.

---

## Architecture notes

**State management** — no Redux or Zustand. Server data lives in TanStack Query
(`staleTime` 60s, `gcTime` 5min, single retry, no refetch on focus or reconnect). Local
state is `useState`. Two React contexts: `AuthContext` and `NotepadContext`.

**Realtime** — one channel per concern, with `invalidateQueries` as the refresh
mechanism. A single shared `realtimeBus` (`src/lib/realtime.ts`) exists specifically to
avoid exhausting Supabase's per-project channel limit.

**Path alias** — `@/` → `src/`, declared in both `vite.config.ts` and `vitest.config.ts`.

**Two Vite configs** — `vite.config.ts` for the app (includes `lovable-tagger` in dev) and
`vitest.config.ts` for tests.

**Permissions are layered** — `src/lib/access.ts` holds the permission engine;
`AuthContext.canAccess` pre-empts a few keys before delegating to it.

---

## Getting started

Requires **Node.js 18+** and npm. [Install via nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pastry-marketing/Marshmallow.git
cd Marshmallow
npm install
npm run dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Supabase project values.

To work on the database:

```sh
npm run sb:link
```

---

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (flat config) |
| `npm test` | Vitest, single run |
| `npm run test:watch` | Vitest, watch mode |
| `npm run sb:link` | Link the Supabase CLI to a project |
| `npm run sb:migrations` | List migration status |

---

## Testing

```sh
npm test
```

**27 test files, 306 tests passing.** Vitest with jsdom, tests co-located beside source
as `*.test.ts`. Supabase is mocked rather than hitting a test database.

Seven hand-run SQL harnesses in `supabase/tests/` cover what unit tests cannot — RLS and
role gates against real data:

| Harness | Covers |
|---|---|
| `20_manual_lead_gate.sql` | Manual lead gate and RLS hardening |
| `30_paid_status_rules.sql` | `paid` immutability and who may set it |
| `40_leads_rls_baseline.sql` | Per-role visible-lead matrices, diffed before/after policy changes |
| `50_tech_performance.sql` | Technician performance RPC and its admin gate |
| `60_optimized_areas.sql` | Optimized areas, area performance, location parsing |
| `70_google_sheets_sync_health.sql` | Sheets sync health, error pruning, lag watchdog |
| `80_urgent_review_gate.sql` | Urgent gate behaviour: blocked and admitted transitions, self-approval, schedule preservation |

These are **not** wired into any runner — run them in the Supabase SQL editor and read
the `PASS`/`FAIL` rows.

> When changing a `SELECT` policy, run `40_leads_rls_baseline.sql` before **and** after,
> and diff the two matrices.

### Harnesses assert behaviour, not existence

`80_urgent_review_gate.sql` is the clearest example of why. The first version of the
urgent gate had its condition inverted: it fired when status did **not** change, so every
real transition into urgent passed straight through while unrelated edits to
already-urgent leads were rejected instead.

It compiled. It applied cleanly. An existence check — "is the trigger there?" — would
have passed on it. Only executing a real transition and reading what the database
actually did catches that class of bug, so the behavioural checks there perform real
updates and assert on the outcome. Checks 8 and 9 read the function source and fail if
a schedule column is ever assigned.

---

## Migration workflow (important)

**Migrations are applied manually in the Supabase SQL editor.** The agent does not run
`supabase db push` or `db reset` against a shared project.

1. Write the migration in `supabase/migrations/`
2. Open the file from GitHub as raw text, copy it
3. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor and run
4. Report the result

Always make migrations idempotent (`IF EXISTS` / `IF NOT EXISTS` / `CREATE OR REPLACE`)
and give every file a header explaining the defect it fixes plus a rollback section.
Never write `UPDATE public.leads` in a migration.

> Verify database changes by **executing the query text from the file itself**, not a
> retyped copy. A retype can silently differ from what ships — that gap has hidden two
> real defects in this project.

### Bringing up the urgent AI check

Four steps, in this order. The first two are easy to miss and the feature is inert
without both.

1. **Apply the migration** — `20261104000000_urgent_review_gate.sql` in the Supabase SQL
   editor. Without it the trigger does not exist and a `customer_service` user can still
   set `urgent_job` directly. Nothing is enforced by the dialog alone.
2. **Set the secret** — `OPENAI_API_KEY` under Edge Functions → Secrets. Use a
   **Secret API key** nowhere; the Edge Function secret is the only place this belongs.
3. **Deploy the function** — `supabase/functions deploy check-urgent-lead --project-ref
   <ref>`. The web dashboard editor cannot resolve `../_shared/quo-ai.ts`, so either
   deploy via CLI or inline those three helpers.
4. **Run the harness** — `80_urgent_review_gate.sql`, and expect every row `PASS`.

Roles: `admin`, `processor` and `cs_admin` pass through the check without seeing the
dialog. `customer_service` is gated, and a `cs_admin` cannot approve a request they
raised themselves.

Urgent is dispatch priority and **never changes the agreed schedule**. Nothing in
`approve_urgent_verification`, `approve_urgent_acknowledgement` or
`review_urgent_request` writes `scheduled_date`, `scheduled_time_start` or
`customer_schedule_requirements`; harness checks 8 and 9 fail if that ever changes.

---

## Deployment

Hosted on **Lovable** — `lovable-tagger` runs in dev builds and `components.json` carries
the shadcn config.

`vercel.json` contains a single SPA rewrite so client-side routing survives refresh:

```json
{ "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }] }
```

## Technical debt

Known gaps, recorded so they are not rediscovered:

- **No CI.** `.github/` does not exist; nothing runs on push or PR.
- **Playwright is configured but unused** — dependency and config are present, zero specs.
- **`/crm-updates` is unreachable.** `crm_updates` is missing from `ALL_NAV_ITEMS`, so the
  guard rejects it before reaching its own branch. The feature works inside
  Settings → CRM Updates.
- **In-app docs disagree with code** on OPR status-change access — `documentation-content.ts`
  says `partial_paid`, `STATUS_CHANGE_ACCESS` has `opr: []` and `opr_admin: []`.
- **`types.ts` is behind the schema.** Newer tables and RPCs are still called through
  `as never` casts. Regenerate with the Supabase CLI; never hand-edit.
- **Supabase URL and key are hardcoded** in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` instead
  of read from `import.meta.env`.
- **`.env.example` still lists AI variables** (`AI_MODEL_*`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) that no
  source file reads.
- **No automated RLS tests** — the harnesses are manual.
- **One-off scripts at repo root** (`fix*.cjs`, `rewrite.cjs`, `test-*.cjs`) could be archived.

---

## House rules

Contributing conventions are documented in [`GEMINI.md`](./GEMINI.md):

1. **Verify all five layers** for any role or feature change — UI, frontend permissions,
   database RLS, Edge Functions, database types. Never declare it done until the full chain
   from click to storage agrees.
2. **Always notify** when a migration is added or changed, so it can be run manually.
